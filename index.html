          <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela[1] Xhosa:  18 July 1918 5 December 2013) was a South African
            anti-apartheid activist who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994 
            to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a 
            fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the
             legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African
             nationalist and socialist, he served as 
           the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.</p>

            A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's 
            white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that 
            privileged whites,

          <p>Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right 
            denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, 
            and described as the "Father of the Nation".</p>
